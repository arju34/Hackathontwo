            <p> A <strong>four-year college</strong> is a university or college that provides a standard four year program outline so that students can receive a bachelor's degree. You do not have to finish in exactly four years, the student has the option to take less or more time then four years in order to gain a bachelor's degree. Now you may be wondering, why are they only focusing on a bachelor's degree? A <strong> bachelor's degree </strong> is the degree that gives you the most options when it comes to choosing a future career. By gaining a bachelor's degree, you have the option of working many types of jobs that require or recommend to have certain degrees, apply for graduate school to continue education to become more advanced careers or even use that degree to teach subjects that you've mastered in. While there are many types of options for what degree you can get such as an associate's degree or a certificate, a bachelor's degree gives you job security and stability while giving you the most amount of options for what you want to do in life.</p>

                  <strong>An associate's degree</strong> is a degree awarded after completing a two-year program. These degrees are much more specialized and only a limited amount of careers can be qualified with an associate's degree but they are much more cost effective and prepare you for a bachelor's degree. Most <strong>community colleges</strong> are known to award an associate's degree but many four-year colleges can also have associate's programs. While community college is known for giving associate's degree, a benefit is that courses can be taken at community colleges to transfer credits to a four-year institution. This is why going to community college or getting an associate's degree for many individuals will be beneficial for them and is a great option.

                  <strong>A certificate</strong> is an award given to work in specific careers which may limit the career options a person has but is the cheapest option out of many programs to complete. Most certificates are awarded by <strong>trade or vocational schools</strong> which are schools that are specialized in training how to perform well in specific careers. Some schools take much less time to complete making this more accesible for many students. This type of award is also given by four-year and two-year institutions as well so if the target is a specific career then this is a very good option.

                  <strong>A master's degree</strong> is a specialized degree which takes much longer to attain. A master's degree can usually only be attained by completing a bachelor's degree prior to applying for a master's program. This means that a person would have to atleast go through college for some time before trying to complete a master's programs. Master's programs are essentially graduate degrees meaning a student has completed their undergraduate coursework along with prerequisites required to apply for this type of program. <strong>Graduate programs</strong> may include MD, DDS, MPH, MBA, and many other types of degrees. While this may be a costly and timeful decision, this type of degree garuntees job security and allows someone to have a higher degree of specialization which can only be acquired through such intensive programs and in the end giving a person a higher paying career.

                  <strong>A doctorate degree</strong> is one of the most advanced degree a person can pursue in higher education. This type of degree is given great respect as people who hold these degrees are experts in their respective areas and have the ability to teach college level classes and higher.

          <p> This may be one of hardest questions to answer especially during current situations. Nowadays you do not need to go to college to have a successful career with a happy life. The choice about picking what you should do after high school is a very big decision but also a very important one. If a career of doing physical demanding jobs is best suited for you then you may need only a certificate degree or require no degree at all. If you are going for a specialized career that requires more experience than education, an associate's or bachelor's degree may be enough. If you want to go into a specific field such as medicine, engineering, law or any other sectors then you may require a bachelor's, master's or doctorate degree. This type of decision all depends on the future career you are interested in. You may not know what that is right after high school so it's good to try different things, shadow other careers, and just experience a day in the life of some jobs to know what you want to do. However, if you do decide to end up going to college, there are many factors to consider when picking the right college for you.</p>
